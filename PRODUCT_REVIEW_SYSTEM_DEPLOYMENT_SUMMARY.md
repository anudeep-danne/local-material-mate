## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.reviews (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    supplier_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    vendor_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    order_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    comment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);
```

### **Key Constraints**
- ✅ Unique constraint: `reviews_product_vendor_order_unique`
- ✅ Foreign key relationships to all related tables
- ✅ Rating validation (1-5 stars)
- ✅ Automatic timestamp management

### **Database Functions**
- ✅ `calculate_product_average_rating(product_uuid UUID)`
- ✅ `calculate_supplier_average_rating(supplier_uuid UUID)`

### **Security (RLS Policies)**

- ✅ Suppliers can view reviews about their products
- ✅ Vendors can only review products they've ordered
- ✅ Vendors can only update/delete their own reviews

## 🔄 **Review Flow**

### **Vendor Review Process**
1. **Select Supplier**: Choose from recent order suppliers
2. **Select Order**: Choose specific order from supplier
3. **Select Product**: Choose product from that order
4. **Rate & Comment**: Provide 1-5 star rating and comment
5. **Submit**: System validates and saves review

### **Validation Rules**
- ✅ One review per product per vendor per order
- ✅ Rating must be 1-5 stars
- ✅ Comment cannot be empty
- ✅ Order must exist and belong to vendor
- ✅ Product must exist and belong to supplier

## 📊 **Rating Calculations**

### **Product Rating**
```
Product Rating = Average of all ratings for that specific product
```

### **Supplier Rating**
```
Supplier Rating = Average of all product average ratings for that supplier
```

**Example:**
- Supplier has 3 products
- Product A: 4.5 average (10 reviews)
- Product B: 4.0 average (5 reviews)
- Product C: 3.5 average (3 reviews)
- Supplier Rating = (4.5 + 4.0 + 3.5) / 3 = 4.0

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**
