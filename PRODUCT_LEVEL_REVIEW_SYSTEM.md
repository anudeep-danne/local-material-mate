# Product-Level Review System

## 🎯 Overview

The Product-Level Review System has been completely redesigned to support granular product reviews instead of supplier-level reviews. This allows vendors to review individual products they've purchased, providing more detailed and actionable feedback.

## 🏗️ Database Schema

### Reviews Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.reviews (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    supplier_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    vendor_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    order_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    comment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);
```

### Key Constraints

- **Unique Constraint**: `reviews_product_vendor_order_unique` prevents multiple reviews per product per vendor per order
- **Foreign Keys**: Links to `products`, `users` (supplier), `users` (vendor), and `orders` tables
- **Rating Validation**: Rating must be between 1 and 5

### Database Functions

```sql
-- Calculate average rating for a specific product
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_product_average_rating(product_uuid UUID)
RETURNS DECIMAL AS $$
DECLARE
    avg_rating DECIMAL;
BEGIN
    SELECT COALESCE(AVG(rating), 0) INTO avg_rating
    FROM public.reviews
    WHERE product_id = product_uuid;
    
    RETURN avg_rating;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Calculate average rating for a supplier (average of all product ratings)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_supplier_average_rating(supplier_uuid UUID)
RETURNS DECIMAL AS $$
DECLARE
    avg_rating DECIMAL;
BEGIN
    SELECT COALESCE(AVG(product_avg), 0) INTO avg_rating
    FROM (
        SELECT calculate_product_average_rating(p.id) as product_avg
        FROM public.products p
        WHERE p.supplier_id = supplier_uuid
    ) product_ratings;
    
    RETURN avg_rating;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## 🔄 Review Flow

### 1. Vendor Review Submission

**Process:**
1. Vendor selects a supplier from recent orders
2. Vendor selects a specific order
3. Vendor selects a product from that order
4. Vendor provides rating (1-5 stars) and comment
5. System validates:
   - Vendor has ordered this product from this supplier
   - Vendor hasn't already reviewed this product for this order
   - Rating and comment are valid

**Validation Rules:**
- One review per product per vendor per order
- Rating must be 1-5
- Comment cannot be empty
- Order must exist and belong to the vendor

### 2. Rating Calculations

**Product Average Rating:**
```
Product Rating = Average of all ratings for that specific product
```

**Supplier Average Rating:**
```
Supplier Rating = Average of all product average ratings for that supplier
```

**Example:**
- Supplier has 3 products
- Product A: 4.5 average (10 reviews)
- Product B: 4.0 average (5 reviews)  
- Product C: 3.5 average (3 reviews)
- Supplier Rating = (4.5 + 4.0 + 3.5) / 3 = 4.0
