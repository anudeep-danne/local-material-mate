# Review System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

A comprehensive review system has been implemented for both Vendor and Supplier pages, allowing vendors to review suppliers they've purchased from and suppliers to view their ratings and feedback.

## 🔄 Review Flow Logic

### Vendor Review Submission
- **Authentication**: Vendors must be logged in with their unique account
- **Eligibility**: Vendors can only review suppliers they've recently purchased from (last 30 days)
- **Validation**: 
  - One review per supplier per vendor (enforced by unique constraint)
  - Rating must be between 1-5 stars
  - Comment is required and cannot be empty
  - Order must exist and belong to the vendor

### Review Data Structure
Each review contains:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `supplier_id`: ID of the supplier being reviewed
- `vendor_id`: ID of the vendor submitting the review
- `order_id`: ID of the order being reviewed
- `rating`: 1-5 star rating
- `comment`: Text feedback
- `created_at`: Timestamp of review submission
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.reviews (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    vendor_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    supplier_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    order_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    comment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);
```

### Key Constraints
- **Unique Constraint**: `reviews_vendor_supplier_unique` prevents multiple reviews per vendor per supplier
- **Rating Validation**: Rating must be between 1-5
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensures data integrity with users and orders tables

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Vendors**: Can view, insert, update, and delete their own reviews
- **Suppliers**: Can view reviews about them
- **Review Insertion**: Vendors can only insert reviews for suppliers they've ordered from
