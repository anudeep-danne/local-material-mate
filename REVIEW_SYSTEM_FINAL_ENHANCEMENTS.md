# Review System Final Enhancements

## Overview
Completed the review system with delete functionality and corrected rating logic to properly calculate product-specific and supplier-specific ratings.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Delete Review Functionality**
- **Vendor Control**: Vendors can delete their own reviews
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows confirmation before deletion
- **Immediate Update**: UI updates immediately after deletion
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed deletions

### 2. **Corrected Product Rating Logic**
- **Product-Specific**: Each product has its own average rating
- **Supplier-Specific**: Ratings are calculated per product per supplier
- **Vendor Reviews**: Multiple vendors can review the same product from the same supplier
- **Accurate Display**: Product cards show correct average ratings

### 3. **Corrected Supplier Rating Logic**
- **Product Average**: Supplier rating = average of all product ratings
- **Only Rated Products**: Only products with reviews are included in calculation
- **Real-time Updates**: Supplier rating updates when product ratings change

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Files

#### `src/hooks/useProductReviews.ts`
```typescript
// Added delete review function
const deleteReview = async (reviewId: string) => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('reviews')
    .delete()
    .eq('id', reviewId);
  
  if (error) throw error;
  toast.success('Review deleted successfully');
  await fetchReviews();
  return true;
};

// Updated product rating to be supplier-specific
const getProductRating = async (productId: string, supplierId: string) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('reviews')
    .select('rating, order:orders!reviews_order_id_fkey(product:products!orders_product_id_fkey(name))')
    .eq('order.product_id', productId)
    .eq('supplier_id', supplierId); // Added supplier filter
  
  const ratings = data.map(r => r.rating);
  const averageRating = ratings.length > 0 
    ? ratings.reduce((sum, rating) => sum + rating, 0) / ratings.length 
    : 0;
  
  return { productId, averageRating, totalReviews: ratings.length };
};
```

#### `src/pages/vendor/VendorReviews.tsx`
```typescript
// Added delete functionality
const handleDeleteReview = async (reviewId: string) => {
  if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this review?')) {
    const success = await deleteReview(reviewId);
    if (success) {
      fetchData(); // Refresh data
    }
  }
};

// Added delete button in review cards
<Button
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => handleDeleteReview(review.id)}
  className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-700 hover:bg-red-50"
>
  Delete
</Button>
```

#### `src/pages/vendor/BrowseProducts.tsx`
```typescript
// Updated to use supplier-specific product ratings
const rating = await getProductRating(product.id, product.supplier_id);
```

#### `src/pages/supplier/SupplierReviews.tsx`
```typescript
// Calculate supplier rating as average of product ratings
const productRatings = [];
for (const product of products) {
  const rating = await getProductRating(product.id, supplierId);
  if (rating && rating.totalReviews > 0) {
    productRatings.push(rating.averageRating);
  }
}

const averageRating = productRatings.length > 0 
  ? productRatings.reduce((sum, rating) => sum + rating, 0) / productRatings.length 
  : 0;
```

## Rating Logic Flow

### 1. **Product Rating Calculation**
```
Product A from Supplier X:
- Vendor 1: 5 stars
- Vendor 2: 4 stars
- Vendor 3: 3 stars
Average: (5 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 4.0 stars
```

### 2. **Supplier Rating Calculation**
```
Supplier X Products:
- Product A: 4.0 stars (3 reviews)
- Product B: 4.5 stars (2 reviews)
- Product C: 3.5 stars (1 review)
Supplier Average: (4.0 + 4.5 + 3.5) / 3 = 4.0 stars
```

### 3. **Review Management**
```
Vendor Actions:
- Submit review for Product A from Supplier X
- Submit review for Product B from Supplier X (same supplier, different product)
- Delete review for Product A from Supplier X
- Submit new review for Product A from Supplier X (after deletion)
```

## User Experience

2. **View Past Reviews**: See all submitted reviews with ratings and comments
3. **Delete Reviews**: Remove reviews with confirmation dialog
4. **Re-submit Reviews**: Can submit new reviews after deletion

### **Product Rating Display**

- **Real-time Updates**: Ratings update immediately after review changes

### **Supplier Rating Display**

## Database Schema Support
```sql
-- Reviews table supports the enhanced functionality
CREATE TABLE public.reviews (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    vendor_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id),
    supplier_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id),
    order_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.orders(id),
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    comment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);

-- RLS policies support vendor deletion of their own reviews
CREATE POLICY "Vendors can delete their own reviews" ON public.reviews
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = vendor_id);
```
