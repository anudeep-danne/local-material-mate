# ✅ Correct Supplier Display Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Understanding**

You were absolutely right! The issue was **NOT** that all products should be linked to "Viswas Co". The real issue is:

- **Each product should show its actual creator's information**
- **Many suppliers can login and add their products**
- **Each supplier has a unique company name**
- **Products should show the supplier name by whom they are actually created**

## 🔧 **What Was Wrong**

### **Previous Incorrect Approach:**
- ❌ Linked ALL products to one supplier (Viswas Co)
- ❌ Overrode actual supplier data with fallbacks
- ❌ Made all products show the same supplier information

### **Correct Approach:**
- ✅ Each product shows its actual creator's information
- ✅ No overriding of supplier data
- ✅ Real supplier names displayed for each product
- ✅ Multiple suppliers can have their own products

## 🚀 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Database Level:**
- ✅ **Removed incorrect product linking** (reverted the previous migration)
- ✅ **Created proper display functions** (`get_supplier_display_info`)
- ✅ **Added tracking for supplier profile updates**
- ✅ **Created view for product-supplier relationships** (`product_supplier_display`)

### **2. Application Level:**
- ✅ **Removed fallback logic** that was overriding actual supplier data
- ✅ **Let each product show its real creator's information**
- ✅ **Updated display messages** to be more informative
- ✅ **Maintained real-time updates** when suppliers change their profiles

## 📊 **How It Works Now**

### **For Each Product:**
```
Product: Fresh Tomatoes
Supplier: [Actual Creator's Business Name]
Location: [Actual Creator's City, State]
